## ðŸ§  How Selection Sort Works

Selection Sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it at the beginning.

Steps:
1. Loop through the array
2. Find the smallest number in the remaining part
3. Swap it with the current position
4. Repeat until the array is sorted
